<p>Dear Current or Future Real Estate Agent: </p>

<p>I understand you may be working at a brokerage or you’re interested in embarking on a real estate career. </p>

<p>As an established agent, perhaps you’re enthusiastic about your community outside of real estate. After all, everyone wants to live in a nice home, but they also want to send their children to a good school district. If you’re looking to break into the industry, it means you believe what’s possible if you apply yourself, you have a good mindset, and you’re willing to put your head down and go to work. </p>

<p>Sometimes, however, no matter how many leads an agent gets, it’s never good enough. They struggle to take their career to the next level because they don’t spend money in the right places or they don’t receive any training or attention from their broker. It’s a fact that 20% of the agents in the industry handle 80% of the business, and <strong>87% of all agents leave the industry within their first two years.</strong> </p>

<p>Some try to solve this problem by searching for a brokerage with a better commission split, or one that offers more one-on-one attention, or one with sales and marketing training. What keeps them up at 3 a.m. every night, though, is trying to figure out how they can make a better life for themselves. </p>

<p>It can be scary to make the jump from a job with a guaranteed salary to a job that’s commission-based, and too many people set financial goals without building the pipeline to reach those goals. If this problem goes unsolved, they’ll be out of the business and end up as one of the 87%.</p>

<p>My name is Michelle Maloney, and if you want to avoid becoming part of this unfortunate statistic, I’ve got good news: I’m inviting you to become a member of my team. </p>

<p>I got my start in real estate back in 1991 after leaving college to join a small brokerage. However, this brokerage offered little support to newer agents like me, so I left the business to finish my degree and pursue other business interests. After I got back into real estate, I joined another brokerage with the same problem—they offered little support to individual agents. I was personally spending more on advertising than the broker was spending on advertising for the entire brokerage. That’s when I left the business a second time.</p>

<p>My passion for real estate never waned, though, so I decided to return to the business on my own terms. Five years ago, I founded my own brokerage, and the rest is history. </p>

<p>I’ve been in your shoes, and I want to guide you through the right steps so you don’t keep struggling. </p>

<p>I’ve invested plenty of money into my systems and programs, and if you join my team, you’ll get all the one-on-one attention and training you need to succeed. If you’re not yet a licensed agent, I’ll pay for your real estate licensing class and teach you about relationship management and the many other things you don’t learn in real estate class. In other words, you’ll learn how to GET clients and KEEP clients. </p>

<p>Some of the specific features of my solution include:
<ul class="indent">
<li>An aggressive CRM with great templates</li>
<li>One on one training and mentorship</li>
<li>Access to our own YouTube Channel</li>
<li>Access to a Matterport 3D camera</li>
</ul></p>

<p>These deliverables will assure your clients you’re well trained, and that in turn will help you get more clients. My team is exactly what agents who’re looking to advance their career want: a one-stop solution for mentoring, training, systems, accountability, and networking. Sounds great, right?</p>

<p>Of course, there are other alternatives to your situation. You can always join another brokerage, but they won’t provide the training and accountability I can. A big-box brokerage with 150 agents can have just one responsible broker - how much individual attention do you think they can give you? You can also strike out on your own, but you run the risk of incurring serious debt.</p>

<p>Don’t just take my word for it. Consider the stories of two of our established agents: Jessi and Lori. </p>

<p>Jessi owned her own restaurant and worked in a kitchen for 11 years before joining us. She was unsure how good of a salesperson she’d be, but I knew she had a great personality and was heavily involved in the community, which was exactly what I was looking for. After going through our training and mentorship, she became my top producer! She treats every client like a friend and confidant and because of that, clients come to her—she never has to send out so much as a postcard. </p>

<p>Lori was in the insurance business for many years before coming on board. She’s incredibly organized and detail-oriented, but became frustrated when she wasn’t making many sales. We changed this by having a simple sit-down and agreeing she had to change her mindset and dedicate herself to a focused business plan. Shortly after that, her number of sales spiked. </p>

<p>I’m looking for the right type of people to help us build something special. I want positive people who think outside the box and want to change their lives. I’m here to help you make sales, but I’m also here to help you build WEALTH to make your life better.  We’re more than just a logo. </p>

<p>If you like what you hear and accept this offer, you’ll go through our 90-day training period and mentorship program, complete with a full media blitz dedicated to introducing you to the community. If you’re not currently licensed, I’ll pay for your licensing class and give you a year to pay me back. I guarantee that if you don’t sell 10 houses in your first year, you don’t owe me anything.</p>

<p>We’re only looking to fill a handful of spots, so time is limited to take advantage of this opportunity. Don’t hesitate to reach out to me so we can take control of your future together.</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p>Michelle Maloney </p>
